UserLoginService with PHP and MySQL
The followings are the things I might need to improve.

Separate the MYSQL queries
by creating a class handling all the related issues. And last time you asked if I know what is OOP and now I am thinking it is about reusing the codes.
Combine Login\Sign up\ (probably homepage) on the same page.
Should add password resritctions.
When users sign up, the script can check if the particular user has
exists before putin the password and submit the form.
Username can show in the colume and does not rewrite again if the password does not setup sucssessfully.
Add emails to authenticate users when sign up.
Add facebook and In as an alternative way to login.
